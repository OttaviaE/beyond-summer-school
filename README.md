## Say "when": IRT based algorithms to shorten tests

Item Response Theory (IRT) offers an ideal framework for shortening tests by exploiting each item’s measurement precision across levels of the latent trait. We introduce IRT‑based algorithms to identify optimal items for a short test form (STF), grounded on the definition of the desired test characteristics thorugh a target information function. At each iteration, these algoriths select the item best able to minimize the distance between the STF’s information function and the target one. Furthermore, one algorithm models response fatigue, adjusting item choices as administration progresses.

## So simple, yet so effective

The Rasch model links item properties and respondent traits but often proves too restrictive for experimental psychology. Given its equivalence to the inverse‑logit link in binomial generalized linear models (GLMs), Rasch‑style parametrizations via (generalized) linear mixed‑effects models can be derived. This approach models accuracy and response times in experiments with fully-crossed cog structures, often used in congitive and social psychology. By accounting for the sources of variability due to the fully-crossed structure of the data, this approach allow for obtaining a Rasch-like parametrizations of accuracy and response times. Applications range from detecting group‑level effects—such as the SNARC effect in numerical cognition—to probing individual differences in the Implicit Association Test.
